# **Hi there 👋**

I’m an Information Systems student at UPN “Veteran” Jakarta who loves turning ideas into simple digital solutions—whether through code, UI design, or organizing things behind the scenes.

I'm currently exploring what I enjoy most between data, system analysis, and web development—and learning along the way is what makes it fun!

🛠️ Projects I’ve been working on:
🖥️ Built a web-based inventory system using Laravel & MySQL
🎨 Redesigned mobile apps for UI/UX coursework using Figma
🧊 Developed CLI-based programs in C, including a stock and food ordering system

I believe growth doesn’t come from perfection—but from showing up, staying curious, and building consistently.
