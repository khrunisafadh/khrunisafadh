## Hi there 👋

I'm Khoirunnisa Fadilah (you can call me Icha)

I’m a 4th-semester Information Systems student at UPN “Veteran” Jakarta. I enjoy turning ideas into simple digital solutions—whether through coding, UI design, or organizing things behind the scenes.

Right now, I’m still figuring out what I love most between data, system analysis, and web development—but that’s part of the fun!

Some things I’ve been working on lately:
- 🖥️ Building a web-based inventory system with Laravel & MySQL
- 🎨 Redesigning mobile apps for UI/UX coursework
- 🧊 Making a stock management program in C (yes, it runs in the terminal 😅)

I believe learning doesn’t have to be perfect—as long as it’s honest and consistent.
